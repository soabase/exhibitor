1.1.1 - xxxxxxxxxxxxx
=====================
* The S3Client could potentially leak connections due to https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=296676

* Issue 26: Make sure default prefixes don't use underscore as it's reserved

* Include activity class name in log message

* Issue 28: log4j.properties wasn't being written correctly. Thanks to user "mgarski".

* Use the latest Curator version

* Automatic instance management was incorrectly handling instance that had yet to write a heartbeat.
They were treated as stale.

1.1.0 - June 27, 2012
=====================
* IMPORTANT: CLI arguments have changed a bit to support automatic instance addition/removal in the standalone
application. For the core version, several parameter blocks have changed.

* Alternate colors are now supported for the UI. Currently, the choices are red and black. You can also
provide your own version. Go to http://jqueryui.com/download and build a custom style and download it.
Put it in in the classpath as "com/netflix/exhibitor/core/ui/css/jquery/custom/..." where "..." is
the contents of the built JQueryUI files. Rename the css file to "jquery-ui.custom.css". Then, pass
"custom" as the JQueryStyle value.

* Major new feature: Automatic Instance Management. Details here: https://github.com/Netflix/exhibitor/wiki/Automatic-Instance-Management

* Moved to v1.3.11 of the AWS Java SDK

* Additional UITabs now support HTML content. This required adding a new method to the UITab class.

1.0.14 - June 7, 2012
=====================
* Removed eTag support - there are too many edge cases and it doesn't really save very much.

* Added Usage Listing feature to the Explorer tab. This produces a listing report starting
at a given path and producing: Path CreateDate ChildQty DeepChildQty.

* DefaultProperties now have more useful methods.

1.0.13 - May 29, 2012
=====================
* HTTP eTag support broke server UI updates.

* Exhibitor now supports upgrading the ZooKeeper install version by optionally having
the ZooKeeper Install Dir specify a directory and searching that directory for the ZooKeeper
install with the highest version number.

* UI work - prep for i18n.

// 1.0.12 (internal only)

1.0.11 - May 25, 2012
=====================
* Issue 14: typo - wrong counter being decremented in IndexCache.releaseLogSearch()

* Issue 14: cleanup task wasn't using correct JARs for 3.4.x

=====================
* Added a new Analyze feature to detect deadlocks and show lock ownership (assuming Curator
recipe usage)

1.0.9 - May 8, 2012
===================
* Major oversight. Restart significant config changes weren't causing a restart.

* The getSystemState API now sets the ETag response header and respects the “If-None-Match”
request header.

* Made restoring from a backup a bit easier by enhancing the backup selection UI.

1.0.8 - May 7, 2012
===================
* Restore of DELETEs wasn't working due to an internal exception.

* More UI work on modify dialog

* Minor bug fixes

1.0.7 - May 4, 2012
===================
* Added support for modifying ZK data. Note: this must be turned on by setting "allowNodeMutations"
to true in Exhibitor.Arguments. The standalone version has the CLI option "--nodemodification true"
to set this.

* A little less logging of backup changes.

1.0.6 - April 6, 2012
=====================
