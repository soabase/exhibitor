1.0.14 - xxxxxxxxxxxx
=====================
* Removed eTag support - there are too many edge cases and it doesn't really save very much.

* Added Usage Listing feature to the Explorer tab. This produces a listing report starting
at a given path and producing: Path CreateDate ChildQty DeepChildQty.

1.0.13 - May 29, 2012
=====================
* HTTP eTag support broke server UI updates.

* Exhibitor now supports upgrading the ZooKeeper install version by optionally having
the ZooKeeper Install Dir specify a directory and searching that directory for the ZooKeeper
install with the highest version number.

* UI work - prep for i18n.

// 1.0.12 (internal only)

1.0.11 - May 25, 2012
=====================
* Issue 14: typo - wrong counter being decremented in IndexCache.releaseLogSearch()

* Issue 14: IndexResource.getResult wasn't releasing the search object

* Issue 14: cleanup task wasn't using correct JARs for 3.4.x

=====================

recipe usage)

1.0.9 - May 8, 2012
===================
* Major oversight. Restart significant config changes weren't causing a restart.

request header.

1.0.8 - May 7, 2012
===================
* Restore of DELETEs wasn't working due to an internal exception.

* Minor bug fixes

1.0.7 - May 4, 2012

to set this.
